Hacker Rank Relational Algebra Challenges:

Basics of Sets and Relations:
You are given two sets. 
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6} 
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}


1. How many elements are present in A union B?

= 8


2. How many elements are present in A intersection B?
 
= 5


3. How many elements are present in A - B

= 1


4. What is the total number of order pairs present in the Cartesian Prod. A x B?

= 42


Consider the following data table named Student:
Student Name Number Sex 
Ben 3412 M 
Dan 1234 M 
Nel 2341 F 


5. What is the count of rows returned in the following relational selection? 
σ(Number<3000)(Student)

= 2


6. What is the count of attributes (columns) returned in the following projection? 
π(Name, Number)(Student)

= 2

Here is another data table named Teaching Assistants:
Subject ID
Physics 3412
Chemistry 1111
Mathematics 2341 


7. What is the count of rows returned in the following join operation? 
Student ⊳⊲(Number=ID) Teaching Assistants

= 2


Relational Algebra:

8. Which is a join condition that contains an equality operator?

= Equijoins


9. In precedence of set operators the epression is evaluated from:

= left to right


10. Using which language can a user request info from a database?

= query


Database Normalization:


The following unnormalized table named PRODUCT is transformed to first normal form (1NF) by splitting it into two tables which have X and Y rows (such that X <Y) respectively. Both the tables have Z columns.

*Product-ID* *Colors* *Price*
1 Red,Green 15.0
2 Blue 18.0
3 Yellow,Pink 2.5

1. What are the values of X, Y, Z? 

= 3, 5, 2


A particular database is normalized to satisfy a particular level of normalization (either 1NF or 2NF or 3NF). One of the tables contains, among other fields, a column for the City and a column for the Zip Code. Assuming that there is a many-to-one mapping between the set of Zip Code(s) and City, we may conclude that the database is definitely NOT in xNF form. 

2. What is the integer x (1, 2, or 3)? Fill your answer in the text box below.

= 3


A database used by a college’s application stores the relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. We have information for each STUDENT (such as name, date of birth, date of enrollment, student-id) and COURSE (course code, instructor, etc.). In real life, a student takes several courses simultaneously while a subject is studied by several students. 

3. what is the minimum number of tables required to structure this database in accordance with the rules of 2NF normalization?

= 3


A database, normalized as per 2NF rules, has been split into 10 tables. Each of the tables has exactly two columns: one key attribute and one non-key attribute. What is the minimum number of tables required to express this database in 3NF form? 

4. Enter the integer in the text box below.

= 10


Consider the following relation and determinants.

R(a, b,c,d)

a,c -> b,d
a,d -> b
Also, a,b is a primary key for the above relation.

The above relation is in x NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively. 

5. What is the maximum possible value of x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form? 

= 3
